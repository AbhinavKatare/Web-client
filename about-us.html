                <h1>About Pragya Trust</h1>
                <p>Pragya Trust is a non-profit organization, registered in India, dedicated to the exploration of consciousness through the lens of Sanatan Hindu Dharma. Our mission is to provide a platform for people from all walks of life to explore and experience the practical applications of this ancient wisdom.</p>
                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We believe that direct experience is the most powerful way to understand the deeper layers of our existence. Our approach is grounded in the six steps of Sahajawatsha, Dhyan dharana, Yog Pranayam, Jap, Swadhyay n Path, and Yatra. We offer courses, workshops, and retreats that are designed to guide participants through these steps, helping them to cultivate a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.</p>
                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Pragya Trust was founded in 2015 by Dr. Jyotika Saini, a renowned psychologist and spiritual teacher. Dr. Saini has dedicated her life to the study of consciousness and its impact on human experience. Her vision for Pragya Trust is to create a global community of conscious explorers who are committed to personal growth and collective evolution.</p>
